## 🧑🏻‍💻 Something about me

My name is Franco, I'm a self‑taught Full‑Stack developer based on Buenos Aires, Argentina. I started programming 3 years ago and since then I keep learning new things and improving my skills every day. I love to build creative, interactive and eye‑catching websites so that the user gets a unique and unforgettable experience based on current trends and technologies.

As a person with communication and social skills I have a natural predisposition to teamwork and I always try to give my best so that the team can achieve its goals on time. In my free time I like to play guitar, hang out with my friends, meet new people, play with my cat, work on personal projects and play video games.
